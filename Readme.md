# Rent-A-Home

## Project Description

Rent-A-Home is a web application that allows users to list homes for rent and browse available rental listings. This project is built using only frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and stores data in the browser's LocalStorage, making it lightweight and easy to use. The application is fully functional offline and can be hosted on GitHub Pages for live demos.
